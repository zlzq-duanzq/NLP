## Text-Image Pair Generation via Pre-trained Vision-Language Models

Image-to-Text is a common Vision-Language Task. Conversely, we have Text-to-Image tasks, which is helpful in data generation and can pro- vide creative ideas. In our project, we tried to combine these two tasks together, to pro- pose a feasible method of generating a suitable dataset for vision-language tasks such as Im- age Captioning, and to learn about different Image2Text modelsâ€™ performance in predicting the images created by Text2Image tools.
